# Day 12 — MITRE ATT&CK Basics

## What is MITRE ATT&CK?
MITRE ATT&CK is a library of real attacker behaviors.
It helps security teams describe what attackers do in a standard way.

## Why SOC/Security Analysts use it
- Helps explain attacks clearly
- Helps map alerts to attacker behavior
- Helps improve detections and response

## Tactics vs Techniques (simple)
- Tactic = the attacker goal (what they want)
- Technique = how they do it (method)

Example:
Tactic: Initial Access
Technique: Phishing

## What I explored today
I opened the MITRE ATT&CK website and checked the Enterprise matrix.
