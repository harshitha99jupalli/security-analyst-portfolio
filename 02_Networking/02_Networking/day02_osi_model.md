# Day 02 — OSI Model (Networking Basics)

## What is the OSI Model?
The OSI model explains how data travels from one computer to another in 7 layers.

## The 7 Layers
7. Application – User applications (HTTP, DNS, HTTPS)
6. Presentation – Encryption and formatting
5. Session – Manages connections
4. Transport – TCP and UDP
3. Network – IP addressing and routing
2. Data Link – MAC addresses
1. Physical – Cables and hardware

## Why this matters for Security Analysts
- Attacks can happen at different layers
- Phishing = Layer 7
- DDoS = Layer 4
- IP scanning = Layer 3
- Packet sniffing = Layer 2

## Example
When I open a website:
- DNS (Layer 7)
- TCP (Layer 4)
- IP routing (Layer 3)
- Network card (Layer 2)


## My Notes
Understanding OSI helps me analyze logs and alerts better.
